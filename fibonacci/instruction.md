You need to write own **Fibonacci class** that realize two implementation: 
1. Recursive
2. Dynamic
### Part-1. Dynamic implementation
1. Look at the file **dynamic_fibonacci.py**.
2. Run tests:

		python3 -m unittest tests/dynamic_fibonacci_test.py
	You will see that most of them FAILED
3. Now, complete **dynamic_fibonacci.py**
4. After running tests all of them should be passed.
5. Compare your answer with mine located in answers/dynamic_fibonacci.py
6. Commit and push your changes

### Part-2. Recursive implementation
1. Look at the file **brute_force_fibonacci.py**.
2. Run tests:

		python3 -m unittest tests/brute_force_fibonacci_test.py
	You will see that most of them FAILED
3. Now, complete **brute_force_fibonacci.py**
4. After running tests all of them should be passed.
5. Compare your answer with mine located in answers/brute_force_fibonacci.py
6. Commit and push your changes
