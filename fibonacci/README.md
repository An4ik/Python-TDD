You need to write own **Fibonacci class** that realize two implementation: 
1. Recursive
2. Dynamic
### How to use
1. Look at the file **fibonacci.py**.
2. Run tests:

		python3 -m unittest tests/fibonacci_test.py
	You will see that most of them FAILED
3. Now, complete **fibonacci.py**
4. After running tests all of them should be passed.
5. Compare your answer with mine located in answers/fibonacci.py
6. Commit and push your changes
