Baby steps
^^^^^^^^^^^
Here we have description. bla bla bla.

**ToDo:** Implementing simple functions.

**Learn:** Running the tests and find out the approach we are going to use.

**Working directory:**  `**baby_steps** <https://github.com/An4ik/Python-TDD/tree/master/baby_steps>`_


Find minimum.
-------------

1. Look at the file **find_min.py**.

2. To follow TDD the first thing you have to do is to write tests for the given functions. Fortunately for you I've already created tests. (**tests/test_find_min.py**)

3. Run tests::

    python3 -m unittest tests/test_find_min.py
    # Runs 7 tests and all of them are FAILED (failures=7)

4. Now, complete the first failed function in **find_min.py**.

5. Run the tests *(step 3)* and make sure you have +1 passed test.


6. Repeat the steps *4 and 5* until all of them are passed.


7. Compare your answer with mine located in **answers/find_min.py**


You can commit your changes


Find maximum.
-------------

1. Look at the file **find_max.py**.


2. To follow TDD the first thing you have to do is to write tests for the given functions. Fortunately for you I've already created tests. (**tests/test_find_max.py**)


3. Run tests::

    python3 -m unittest tests/test_find_max.py
    # Runs 7 tests and all of them are FAILED (failures=7)

4. Now, complete the first failed function in **find_max.py**.



5. Run the tests *(step 3)* and make sure you have +1 passed test.



6. Repeat the steps *4 and 5* until all of them are passed.



7. Compare your answer with mine located in **answers/find_max.py**


You can commit your changes and smile! You've done good job.
