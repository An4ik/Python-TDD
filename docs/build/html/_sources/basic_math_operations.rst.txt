1. Look at the file **number.py**.

2. We have tests in (**tests/test_number.py**)

3. Run tests::

    python3 -m unittest tests/test_number.py
    # Runs 12 tests and all of them are FAILED (failures=12)

4. Now, complete the first failed function in **number.py**.

5. Run the tests *(step 3)* and make sure you have +1 passed test.


6. Repeat the steps *4 and 5* until all of them are passed.


7. Compare your answer with mine located in **answers/number.py**
