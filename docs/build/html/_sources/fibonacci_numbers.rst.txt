Fibonacci numbers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Fibonacci numbers** are the numbers in the following integer sequence
characterized by the fact that every number after the first two is the sum
of the two preceding ones:

<<<<<<< HEAD

Here was Kerbez
=======
>>>>>>> Decorator fixed

For example:

    [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ...]



We want you write  **Fibonacci class** that realize two implementation:

1. Recursive
2. Dynamic

### Part-1. Dynamic implementation
1. Look at the file **dynamic.py**.

2. Run tests: (you will see that all of them FAILED)

		python3 -m unittest tests/dynamic_fibonacci_test.py

3. Now, implement Fibonacci class, methods in **dynamic.py**

4. After running tests all of them should be passed.

5. Compare your answer with mine located in answers/dynamic_fibonacci.py


### Part-2. Recursive implementation
1. Look at the file **brute_force.py**.
2. Run tests: (you will see that all of them FAILED)

		python3 -m unittest tests/brute_force_fibonacci_test.py

3. Now, complete **brute_force_fibonacci.py**

4. After running tests all of them should be passed.

5. Compare your answer with mine located in answers/brute_force_fibonacci.py
