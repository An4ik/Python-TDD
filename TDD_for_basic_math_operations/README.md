#Basic Math Operations
Test-driven development (TDD) is an evolutionary approach to development which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring. In other words, itâ€™s one way to think through your requirements or design before your write your functional code. TDD for basic math operations means that we will test code and refactor the code.

Part1 1)Look at the file Basic_math_operations.py

2)We write some unit test for basic_math_operators (look at the file tests/find_min_test.py)

3)Run tests:

python3 -m unittest tests/Test_for_basic_math_operations.py You will see that it ran 12 tests and all of them FAILED (failures=12)

4)Now, complete that functions in Basic_math_operations.py

5)After running tests all of them should be passed.
